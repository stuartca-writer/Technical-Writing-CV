<h2>Import APAX-5000/6000 Variables</h2>

WebAccess supports the importing of Advantech APAX-5000 and 6000 series variables, including Tag names and Tag addresses, from the KW CSV file to the WebAccess database. It automatically converts the KW variable address to a Modbus address for runtime exchange real-time data.<br><br>

			When a customer orders a product which is too large to go into a regular container it's classed as a **bulky item**. For the purposes of picking bulky items are treated as **containers** and are given their own barcode.
			
			{: .note}
			> Bulky items are only suitable for **Customer Collection** and only work if in-store fulfillment is configured to use **SKUs**.
			>
			> Bulky item SKUs must be marked as **Bulky** using OSP's SKU API.
			
			## Manage equipment
			
			Before you can start picking bulky items you need to add a bulky items picking cart.
			
			1. From the **Welcome** screen click &#9776;.
			
			2. Click **Manage equipment**.
			
			3. Click **New bulky items picking cart**.
			
			4. Select an item from the list and click **NEXT**.
			
			5. Scan the picking cart's barcode anc click **NEXT**.
			
			6. Check the summary and click **CONFIRM**.
			
			7. You can now either **ADD MORE** bulky item picking carts or click **DONE**.
			
			## Prepare a bulky items cart
			
			Before you can start picking you first need to prepare the cart:
			
			1. In the Store-pick app, on the Welcome screen, tap **Prepare cart**.
			
			2. Scan the barcode of the bulky items picking cart.
			
				A confirmation message is displayed.
			
				{% include image src="store-pick/bulky-prep-cart-msg.png" alt="Bulky cart preparation" width="200" %}
			
			3. Tap **OK** to acknowledge this message and then tap **NEXT** to continue preparing the cart.
			
			## Pick bulky items
			
			{: .note }
			> All temperature regimes are picked at the same time.
			
			Before you start picking bulky items ensure that you have enough printed barcodes for the items you're picking. These can be printed from the [**Store operations dashboard**](../../store-pick/dashboard#pbl).
			
			The picking process is as follows:
			
			1. Scan the product's barcode.
			
			2. Stick the picking barcode on to the product.
			
			3. Scan the picking barcode.
			
			## Out of stock bulky items
			
			If an item is out of stock and the picker marks it as **Missing** you can add the product to the order later if more stock arrives, using the Store Operations web app.
			
			To do this:
			
			1. Go to the [**Pick task details**](../pick-tasks/pick-task-details) page of the product to be picked.
			
			2. Click **ADD ITEM**.
			
			3. Enter the barcode of the product.
			
			4. Enter the barcode of the picking label.
			
			5. Enter the shelf location where you have put the item.</td>
