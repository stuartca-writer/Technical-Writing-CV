<td> Meta Description</td>
<td> An effective meta description should do everything possible to drive someone to make that decision and click. Our focus has to be on persuading the searcher to click -- while still maintaining accuracy so expectations are met. Meta descriptions should generally: <br> 1) Use action-oriented language <br> 2) Provide a solution or benefit, i.e. what are the product feature or key points of the page. How does the product solve the need of the users? <br> 3) Be kept under 160 characters <br> 4) Don't deceive searchers <br> 5) Be specific and relevant to the page content <br> 6) Include call to action <br> 7) Provide specifications for products | 155-160 characters <br> Since Google generally truncates snippets at ~160 characters for mobile search results, try to stay below 160. </td>	 
<td> <ul> Target keywords must be included here and it's best to be incorported up to 2-3 times</ul> <br><ul> The description must be written differently for every page.</ul> <br> <ul> Google may penalize you for mass duplicating your descriptions.</ul> <br><ul> The meta description tag serves the function of advertising copy that draws readers to a site from the SERP.</ul> <br><ul> Crafting a readable, compelling description using important keywords can improve the click-through rate for a given webpage. To maximize click-through rates on search engine result pages, it's important to note that Google and other search engines bold keywords in the description when they match search queries.</ul> <br> <ul> Avoid non-alphanumeric characters including quotation marks, Google tend to cut off descriptions that uses these characters</ul> <br><ul> Set the tone of voice to be consistent with your brand.</ul></td>
