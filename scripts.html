			<b>Child</b><br>
			I used to use pens, paper and books to do my school work. But now I use this great laptop.<br><br>

			<b>Teacher</b><br>
			Kids are always losing and damaging their school pens and books, so we decided to replace them with Chromebooks.<br><br>

			<b>Child</b><br>
			In the mornings before lessons I can watch related videos and then use the camera to take pictures of important things.<br><br>
			
			<b>Teacher</b><br>
			Keeping the kids engaged is important and in, tent mode they can watch videos and take pictures useful to their projects.<br><br>
			
			<b>Child</b><br>
			I like that I can make notes directly on the screen and then come back and look for them later. The pen that it comes with feels just like a real pencil.
